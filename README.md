## Travel Sticky Notes
Hey folks! Welcome to Travel Sticky Notes! Here is where you can create, updated and delete all of the travel destinations of your dreams! We understand that sometimes you're scrolling on the interwebs and you see a beautiful place that you never even new existed. Our app allows you to quickly fill out some basic information and then store it until your ready to go!


## Motivation
The motivation I had for this app was 0% unitl the last 24 hours. Like every project I've done so far, I bit off way more than I could possible chew and found myself running into problem after problem. For 5 solid days, I worked and attempted to debug my project to no avail. So, with 24 hours until the deadline I scrapped my old project and started from complete scratch - which ended in the wonder site you see today. Yes, I built this entire thing in 24 hours. I'm offically a true Software Engineer. While the last 24 hours have been quite hetic, I truly learned more in the last 24 hours than I ever thought possble. Enjoy.

## Unsolved Problems
- While there are no unsolved problems in my code there are plenty of unresolved complaints, starting and ending with Bootstrap. There are plenty of things I could say I have issues with, but since I'm an honest person, I will admit that it was my first time using it and was very confused with how it was applied to my project. With that being said, I believe with time and practice it could be something I dominate in the future.
-Prior to completely switching my app, I did have some problems with relationaly schemas(terminology check) with the previous version of the app. While it's technically not an unresolved issue, it was something I struggled with and would like to work on in the future.

## Future Enhancements
- There are a plethora of things I would love to add to this app in the future, such as:
- Connecting to a flight, hotel, and car rental APIs so that the users can search straight from the app
- Creating a user profile so people can follow their friends and family
- Creating a function that allows people to swap houses for holidays in lieu of paying for lodging
