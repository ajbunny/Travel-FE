## Bunny's Black Magic
For my first e-commerence app, I decided to created a spiritual store called Black Magic where your desired item is just one manifestion away! This prject has been a roller coaster of emotions and learning experiences but it has become something that I am very proud of and something that I look forward to updating for better user experience. Enjoy.



## Motivation
The motivation for this project was simply to do better than my last. Nothing more and nothing less. Everyday I learn that the key to being a success engineer is to break your code...a lot. With this project, I wanted to break my code so much that I was able to understand it inside and out. While I would love to say that I have reached that point, truthfully I had not. However, I learned more on this one project than I ever thought was imaginable so that's a start. Lastly, but certainly not least, my motivation for this app was knowing I was paying tribute to the universe and all that it blesses us with. I truly beleive thoughts are things, and words hold tremendous power. Power of the tongue and the divine power of manifestion are the keys to unlocking all that we want from this realm. For example, I really wanted to complete a cool app that I was really proud of, and I did.

## Credits
First and foremost I would like to thank you amazing peers (Sharon OgBonna, Hadia Shafique, Cody Jennings, Ashunti Ware and Long Hoang) for helping guide, collaborate, and encourage me through various steps through this project. Yall are A1's and don't EVER forget it. I would also like to acknowledge CSS Scan for their incredible button designs. Because of this site, I was not only able to add cool features to my store but I was able to learn the techniques used and how to implement them to other parts of my stores, but I was also inspired to try new techniques that I would have otherwise never thought of.
